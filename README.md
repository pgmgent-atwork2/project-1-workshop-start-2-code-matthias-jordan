# Flappy Bird Game
# This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and you're own imagination.

# Instructions
# Clone this repository to your local machine.
# Open the index.html file in your web browser to play the game.

# How to Play
# Press the Space key to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles.
# Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes to score points.
# The game ends if the bird hits the ground or obstacles.

# Code Overview
# The main game logic is implemented in script.js. Here are some key points:
# The game elements (hole, character, block) are manipulated using JavaScript to create the game environment.
# The bird's jumping mechanism is controlled by listening for the Space key press event.
# The game loop continuously updates the positions of the elements and checks for collisions.
# Sounds are played for jumping and game over events.

# Resources
# Background images and character sprites are stored in the assets folder under img.
# Sound effects are stored in the root directory and implemented in the index.html file.

# Credits
# This project was created by Matthias Cecchi and Jordan Bergmans.
